    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Welcome to my web page! I’m excited to share a bit about myself and my research on the Green Lantern. I took a course called Superheros Across Global Context because my boys are super hero nerds and I thought it would be a good way to connect with them. This paper was my final project for the class.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Beth Janke. I earned an associate degree from Tarrant County College in 1994 and completed a bachelor’s degree in General Studies from Texas Christian University in 2021. I’m currently finishing my Master’s of Liberal Arts at TCU and will graduate in December 2025. My personal interests include spending time with my family, watching hockey, scuba diving, and visiting amusement parks. Through this web authoring course, I hope to build a strong foundation in web development and gain the skills needed to design and manage websites with confidence.</p>
           
        <h2>Web Development Learning</h2>
        <p>During this four week Intro into Web Authoring course I learned the basics of building and styling a website using only HTML and CSS style coding. I learned how to structure content with semantic tags, style layouts and create responsive, user-friendly pages. I also learned how to analyze design using CRAP principles. I wish there had been more time. There are still many areas that I need improvement on but I feel like I have a good foundation for web authoring.</p>
