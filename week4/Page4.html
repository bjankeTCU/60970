        <p>The Green Lantern legacy, shaped first by Alan Scott and later by Hal Jordan, offers more than a tale of two superheroes; it reveals the transformation of American cultural identity across generations.</p>
        <p>Alan Scott, with his mystical origins and clear-cut morality, emerged during an era that prized optimism, simplicity, and individual heroism. His stories aligned with a nation seeking reassurance during global conflict and economic uncertainty.</p> 
        <p>In contrast, Hal Jordan's journey reflected the upheaval of the Cold War, the public skepticism of authority, and the pressing social issues of a rapidly changing society. As both comics and readers matured, Jordan evolved from a loyal enforcer of order into a hero forced to confront institutional failure and cultural unrest.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the evolution of Green Lantern reveals the genre's enduring power: not simply to entertain but to reflect, challenge, and illuminate the values of the times in which its stories are told.
