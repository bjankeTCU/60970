    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Beth Janke. I earned my associate degree from Tarrant County College in 1994 and completed my bachelor’s degree in General Studies with an emphasis in Psychology and Child Development from Texas Christian University in 2021. I’m currently finishing my Master’s of Liberal Arts at TCU. My personal interests include spending time with my family, watching hockey, traveling, and visiting amusement parks. Through this web authoring course, I hope to build a strong foundation in web development and gain the skills needed to design and manage websites with confidence.</p>
        
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I am currently completing my Master’s of Liberal Arts at Texas Christian University, where I’ve had the opportunity to explore a wide range of interdisciplinary subjects. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in General Studies with an emphasis in Psychology and Child Development from TCU in 2021. My academic journey began with an Associate degree from Tarrant County College in 1994. Through my studies, I’ve developed strong skills in critical thinking, communication, and research, and I’m excited to expand my knowledge into web development through this course.</p>
        
        <h2>Interests & Goals</h2>
        <p>What interests me most about web development is the combination of creativity and functionality, how design and structure work together to create an engaging online experience. I’m excited to learn how to build user-friendly websites from the ground up. My academic background in psychology and child development has given me insight into how people think and interact, which I believe is valuable in creating effective, accessible designs. Professionally, I hope to gain a solid foundation in web authoring that I can apply to future projects, whether in education, communication, or personal creative work.</p>
