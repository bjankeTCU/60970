# Green Lantern Evolution Project – README

## Project Overview
This project explores the evolution of the Green Lantern character and how comic book storytelling reflects changing American cultural and political landscapes. Originally developed as an academic research paper, the content was adapted into a web-friendly format using only HTML and CSS.

## What I Learned

### 1. **Adapting Academic Content for the Web**
I learned how to translate dense, formal writing into content that is readable, engaging, and accessible to a broader audience. This meant simplifying language, using shorter paragraphs, and organizing ideas with clear headings and visual structure.

### 2. **Web Design with HTML & CSS**
Using only HTML and CSS, I gained hands-on experience with semantic structure, the box model, flexbox, and responsive design. I also learned how to use layout and styling to guide user attention and improve readability across different devices.

### 3. **User Experience & Visual Hierarchy**
I discovered the importance of designing for how users read on the web—scanning, not reading word-for-word. Techniques like spacing, font sizing, and color contrast helped me present complex ideas more effectively.
