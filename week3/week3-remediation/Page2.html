        <h3>Magic vs. Law: Two Lanterns, Two Worlds</h3>
        <p>Alan Scott and Hal Jordan may both be Green Lanterns, but their worlds couldn’t be more different.</p>

        <p>Alan Scott’s powers came from a mystical flame and a prophecy, guiding him to fight crime as a lone vigilante. His adventures were grounded in magic, myth, and personal justice, no cosmic bosses, just one man doing what’s right.</p>
        <img src="images/HJFindsLantern.jpg" width="100%" alt="Jordan find lantern">
        <p>Hal Jordan, on the other hand, served a structured space police force, the Green Lantern Corps, under the watchful eyes of the ancient Guardians of the Universe. While Hal started as a loyal soldier, he quickly found himself questioning orders, especially when justice clashed with authority.</p>
        <p>Where Scott’s world celebrated myth and moral clarity, Jordan’s stories tackled hierarchy, corruption, and moral complexity, mirroring a society growing more skeptical of institutions.</p>
