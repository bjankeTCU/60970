        <p>As America faced civil rights struggles, war protests, and deep cultural divides in the 1960s and ’70s, Hal Jordan’s stories began to reflect the real world</p>
        <p>No longer just a cosmic enforcer, Hal teamed up with the fiery Green Arrow to confront racism, poverty, drug abuse, and even political corruption. In the groundbreaking Green Lantern/Green Arrow series, readers saw heroes challenge not just villains, but broken systems.</p>
        <p>One powerful moment: a Black man asks Hal why he’s helped “blue, orange, and purple skins,” but ignored Black people on Earth. It was a wake-up call, for Hal and his readers.</p>
        <img src="images/BlackSkins.jpg" width="100%" alt="Hal confronted with racism">
        <p>These stories marked a turning point. Superheroes weren’t just saving the day—they were questioning power, reflecting society, and growing up with their audience.</p>
